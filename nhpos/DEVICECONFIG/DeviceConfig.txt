# This is the device configuration file that is used by the DeviceConfig utility
# to configure devices for a terminal.
#
# lines begining with a pound sign (#) are comment lines and are ignored.
# lines that are empty or contain only blanks are used to indicate the beginning of a new
# section.  Multiple blank lines are ignored.
#
# Each section describes a possible type of device.  There are three main kinds of devices:
#      DIRECT uses the older direct to communications port protocol
#      OPOS uses the new OPOS control protocol which is implemented for a few devices
#      NOTE means that the device doesn't use a control as such and this is a data item
#      WEDGE means that the device is a wedge keyboard type of device
#
# The format of each section is as follows:
#      line 1 -> Contains the name of the device such as NCR 7194 Printer
#                This line is used as a registry key to identify the specific device.
#                    . for DIRECT devices used as registry key beneath Platform Software\SystemConfig\SystemParameter
#                Ensure it is same as defined string in SCF.H such as SCF_DEVICENAME_EPTEXDLL_MERCURY.
#      line 2 -> the DLL to use if this is a DIRECT device.
#                The registry key beneath OLEforRetail\ServiceOPOS for OPOS devices (for instance CashDrawer)
#                   - Same as SCF_OPOS_NAME_aaaaa in SCF.H source such as SCF_OPOS_NAME_POSPRINTER
#      line 3 -> the Active device type which describes the type of work the device does
#                For OPOS devices with options
#                    . use as registry key beneath Platform Software\SystemConfig\SystemParameter
#                This value is one of the Active device registry keys used to find active devices.
#                    . used as registry key beneath Platform Software\SystemConfig\ActiveDevice
#                BEVERAGE -> device is a beverage dispenser
#                CDISPLAY -> device is a customer display or Line Display
#                COIN -> device is a coin dispenser
#                DRAWER -> device is a Cash Drawer
#                KEYBOARD -> device is a keyboard
#                KITCHEN_CRT -> device is a kitchen CRT or Kitchen Display System
#                KITCHEN_PRINTER -> device is a kitchen printer (normally a dot matrix printer)
#                MSR -> device is a magnetic strip reader
#                PRINTER -> device is a POS Printer (normally a thermal receipt printer)
#                SCALE -> device is a scale
#                SCANNER -> device is a scanner
#                PINPAD1 -> device is a PIN Pad device such as Ingenico i6550
#      line 4 -> the device interface:
#            DIRECT -> device connects to a COMM port and uses a proprietary DLL
#            OPOS -> device connects through an OPOS control
#            ETHERNET -> device is accessed through an Ethernet LAN using an IP address
#            NOTE -> device is none of the above but should be noted.  Mainly used for keyboards.
#            WEDGE -> device uses a keyboard wedge interface.  Mainly used for MSR
#      line 5 has several different uses depending on the device type
#            DIRECT -> COMM port settings for the device baud, bits, parity, stop, handshake (9600,8,NONE,1,NONE)
#            ETHERNET -> IP address and IP port number (192.168.0.23, 2172)
#            OPOS -> the registry subkey for the device profile as installed by NCR Retail Services Manager (RSM)
#                 example: (NCRCashDrawer.2 beneath OLEforRetail\ServiceOPOS\CashDrawer)
#	 line 6 -> Contains Options specific for the specified device profile.
#
# The data in the lines for each device are stored in keys and values in the Windows Registry.
#
# NOTICE:
#   The data that is already stored in the Windows Registry takes precedence over the descriptions in this
#   file so you will need to delete any registry items that need to be reset using changes that have been made to this file.
#
# WARNING to Development:
#   The device name on line 1 of each set of entries must agree with the defines in SCF.H
#
# The data is first stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/NCR/Platform Software/SystemConfig/SystemParameter
# The first line containing the name of the device is used to create a key in SystemParameter with that device name.
# The following lines are used to add values to the key.
#   - line 2 is put into DLLName
#   - line 3 is put into TypeName
#   - line 4 is put into ActivePort
#   - line 5 is ignored for OPOS and WEDGE devices
#   - line 5 is parsed and put into the following items for DIRECT devices
#      . Baud
#      . CharBit
#      . Parity
#      . StopBit
#      . HandShake
#   - line 5 is parsed and put into the following items for ETHERNET devices
#      . IPAddr
#      . Port
#   - line 6 will vary
#
# OPOS devices uses the profiles stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/OLEForRetail/ServiceOPOS
# These profiles are setup using the NCR Retail Services Platform application
#
# This first entry for the genpos web portal url is a special entry to provide a way to modify
# the URL that the Terminal Register dialog of DeviceConfig uses for the Fetch button.  This first
# entry is not displayed in the DeviceConfig list of devices. It must be modified using a text editor.
# The URL entered must have a trailing slash since additional information will be appended.
